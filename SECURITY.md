## Reporting a security issue

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Do not submit an issue or pull request: this might reveal the vulnerability.

Instead, you should contact Wyvest#0001 or any of the developers via our discord server (in a support ticket or DM)

We will deal with the vulnerability privately and submit a patch as soon as possible.
